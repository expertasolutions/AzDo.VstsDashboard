# CI/CD Dashboard

## Objectives

Provide a simple way to view all Builds and Releases on a single page.
The intend was to see what's currently happened into the CI/CD pipeline and provide quick feedback of what's going on.

## Local setup from the code
1) Create a file named 'vsts.appsettings.json' into the folder 'Configs/Docker'.
    This file will not get push into git (see .gitignore file)
2) Copy the content of the file 'vsts.appsettings.template.json' into your file 'vsts.appsettings.json'
3) Put your AzureDevOps value into these properties
    - TfsUrl: Tfs Url of your Tfs or Azure DevOps source control
        - AzureDevOps -> (https://dev.azure.com/{your_organization_name}/)
        - Tfs On Premise -> (http|https://{your_tfs_server}:8080/tfs/DefaultCollection)
    - PAT: Personal Access Token from your AzureDevOps (just give access to read to build and release scope)
    - ApiVersion: Set the API-version for builds, releases and projects TFS Rest API
      To find the specifics ApiVersion required, please take a look on the [Azure DevOps Services REST API Reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/azure/devops/?view=azure-devops-rest-5.0) to find which apply to your TFS.

## Example of vsts.appsettings.json
### Azure DevOps vsts.appsettings.json
```json
{
  "env": {
    "name":"prod"
  },
  "TfsAccessInfo": {
    "TfsUrl":"https://dev.azure.com/__yourOrg__/",
    "pat":"__yourPAT__",
    "apiVersion": {
      "projects": "5.0-preview.3",
      "builds": "5.0-preview.2",
      "releases": "5.0-preview.5",
      "resourceAreas": "5.0-preview.1"
    }
  }
}
```
### Azure DevOps Server vsts.appsettings.json
```json
{
  "env": {
    "name":"prod"
  },
  "TfsAccessInfo": {
    "TfsUrl": "https://{YOUR_TFS_IP}:8080/tfs/defaultCollection/",
    "pat": "__yourPAT__",
    "apiVersion": {
      "projects": "4.1",
      "builds":"4.1",
      "releases":"4.1-preview.2",

2) Type this command 'docker-compose build && docker-compose up --force-recreate' and wait
3) Open a web browser on 'http://localhost:3000' and 'ta-da' !!!
