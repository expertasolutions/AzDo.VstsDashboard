# CI/CD dashboard

Provide a simple way to view all Builds and Releases on a single page.
The intention was to see what's currently happened into the CI/CD pipeline and provide quick feedback of what's going on. See ***[Release notes](https://github.com/expertasolutions/VstsDashboard/releases)***

## **Important**:
- **Pipeline YAML**, due to missing Rest API functionality to extract Pipeline Deployment Stage in Pipeline Yaml, theyâ€™re not supporting viewing Deployment Stage health. There is a way to extract the information, but this will cause a major overhead in terms of usability of this extension to your users account request per min on Azure DevOps Service.
- **After February 5th, 2022**, there **no longer support** to enhance on this extension. Since we moved all of our Projects on GitHub
